    <h3>Extra Info</h3>        
    <h4>(I felt like adding more so here I am adding more stuff)</h4>
    <p>I really like playing video games, epecially when the story/lore of the game really interests me (which is why I used 2 pictures of Destiny). A good story can make 
        the difference when you are playing. It's the same with D&D when you get really into it and see things about your characters backstory be implemented.
